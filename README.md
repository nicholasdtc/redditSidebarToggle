=========================
|| redditSidebarToggle ||
=========================

This is a Google Chrome extension that adds a tab on reddit.com to show/hide the sidebar.
Also there is an option to completely remove that multireddits bar to the left*.

* Use the extension's options menu on chrome to set your preference on the multireddits bar.

===========
|| TO-DO ||
===========

- Add an option for a compact tab.
- Add 'back to top' button at the end of the page, make it scroll back to zero.
- Maybe change the extension name since I'm adding a lot of other stuff.
